## Tags

In HTML, everything is represented by tags. Tags come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The content of the element is placed between these tags.

### Self-Closing Tags

Self-closing tags don't require a closing tag because they don't contain any content. They are closed with a forward slash (/) before the closing angle bracket.

Common self-closing tags include `<br>` for line breaks and `<input>` for input fields.

### Closing Tags

Closing tags are used to enclose content and need to be closed explicitly when their scope ends. They have an opening tag and a corresponding closing tag.

Common closing tags include `<div>` for defining divisions or sections and `<ul>` for unordered lists.

## Attributes

Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are added to the opening tag and consist of a name and a value, separated by an equals sign (=) and enclosed in double quotation marks (" ").

Attributes can be used to modify the behavior or appearance of an element. For example, the `name` attribute in an `<input>` tag specifies the name of the input field.

## Semantic Tags

Semantic tags in HTML describe the meaning or purpose of the content they enclose. They provide a way to structure the document and give it more context. Using semantic tags can improve accessibility and search engine optimization.

Examples of semantic tags include `<header>` for representing the header or introductory content, `<nav>` for defining a container for navigation links, and `<article>` for representing an independent piece of content.

## Non-Semantic Tags

Non-semantic tags, such as `<div>` and `<span>`, are generic container elements that do not convey any specific meaning about their content. They are often used for styling purposes or to group elements together without implying any particular semantic structure.

While non-semantic tags do not provide inherent meaning to the content, they can still be useful in organizing and styling the layout of a web page.
